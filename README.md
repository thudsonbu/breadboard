# Integrations
Integration between [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) and [Todoist](todoist.com).
Currently, working on receiving item completed events from the [Todoist Sync
API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/#overview) and creating a completed
task in Habitica in order to keep experience and coins up to date.
